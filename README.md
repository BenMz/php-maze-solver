# PHP - Maze Solver

Project I did back in 2015 in PHP where you can solve a maze, given a start and an end point, using:

  - Breadth-first Search
  - Depth-first Search
  - A*

The maze is an image that can be taken directly from the camera of your laptop/device. Code is written using Singleton and Factory pattern.
